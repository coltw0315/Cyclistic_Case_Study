# ðŸš² Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes **bike-share data (Q1 2019 & Q1 2020)** from **Cyclistic**, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to understand usage patterns between **casual riders** and **annual members**, and provide insights that can help the marketing team convert casual users into paying members.  

The analysis was completed in **R** using an **RMarkdown report** that combines data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualization.  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Business Task  
Identify key differences in how **casual riders** and **members** use Cyclistic bikes, and recommend strategies to convert more casual riders into annual members.  

---

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries  
- **R / RStudio**  
- **tidyverse** â€“ data wrangling & visualization  
- **lubridate** â€“ date-time manipulation  
- **scales** â€“ formatting chart labels  
- **ggplot2** â€“ creating charts  

---

## ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations  
1. **Rides by Day of Week** â€“ members ride more on weekdays; casuals ride more on weekends.  
2. **Average Ride Length by Day** â€“ casuals take longer rides, members take shorter commuter trips.  
3. **Monthly Ride Volume** â€“ member rides are steady, casual rides fluctuate seasonally.  
4. **Top 10 Start Stations** â€“ members use commuter-heavy stations, casuals use touristy areas.

## ðŸ”‘ Insights  
- **Members** â†’ consistent weekday usage, shorter rides, commuter-oriented.  
- **Casual riders** â†’ weekend spikes, longer trips, tourist/recreational behavior.  
- **Spatial patterns** â†’ members start at transit hubs, casuals at parks/waterfronts.  

---

## âœ… Recommendations  
- Offer **weekend promotions** targeted at casual riders.  
- Build **employer partnerships** to push memberships for daily commuters.  
- Place **QR-code ads at tourist stations** to encourage casual-to-member conversion.
