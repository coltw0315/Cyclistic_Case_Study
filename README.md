# Cyclistic_Case_Study
This project analyzes bike-share data (Q1 2019 &amp; Q1 2020) from Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. The goal is to understand usage patterns between casual riders and annual members, and provide insights that can help the marketing team convert casual users into paying members.
